# Interactive-Forces-Simulator

An Interactive simulator to explain physics by visualizing the forces acting on an object while it is in circular motion around a stationery point and users can change mass, radius, etc.

This was created in a team of 3, and a java IDE will be required to run this project. 

This was intended to be used by a teacher to help students visualize circular motion.
